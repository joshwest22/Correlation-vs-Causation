<h1> Correlation vs Causation</h1>
<div id="correlation">
<p>Correlation implies that there is a relationship between variables. Correlation only applies when the relationship is linear.</p>
<p>The measure for correlation is represented by the correlation coefficient, r, which ranges from -1 to 1. The close r is to 1 or -1, the stronger the relationship is to a varible.</p>
</div>
<div id="difference">
<p>It is crucial to recognize that correlation is <i>NOT</i> the same thing as causation. That is to say that just because data lines with a trendline doesn't mean that one variable caused the effect represented by the data. </p>
<p>According to Cairo, the only reasonable way to determine causation is to run randomized controlled experiments until all irrelevant variables have been eliminated.</p>

        <ul><li>This graph is a good way to show correlation while mitigating bias. This helps show a more accurate representation of the population the data actually represents.</li></ul>

        <li>Scatter Plot Matrices
        <ul><li>Scatter plot matrices are tailored to explore multivariable data. Scatter plot matrices allow you to easily compare how different factors effect the correlation between them.
