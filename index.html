<h1> Correlation vs Causation</h1>
<div id="correlation">
<p>Correlation implies that there is a relationship between variables. Correlation only applies when the relationship is linear.</p>
<p>The measure for correlation is represented by the correlation coefficient, r, which ranges from -1 to 1. The close r is to 1 or -1, the stronger the relationship is to a varible.</p>
</div>
<div id="difference">
<p>It is crucial to recognize that correlation is <i>NOT</i> the same thing as causation. That is to say that just because data lines with a trendline doesn't mean that one variable caused the effect represented by the data. </p>
<p>According to Cairo, the only reasonable way to determine causation is to run randomized controlled experiments until all irrelevant variables have been eliminated.</p>
